I’ve developed a multifunctional Telegram bot designed for educational purposes in ethical hacking. This bot can perform a variety of tasks, including:

- 📸 Taking screenshots  
- 📷 Capturing camera snapshots  
- 🔑 Displaying saved Wi-Fi passwords  
- 💻 Adding itself to startup  
- 🔔 Showing alert messages  
- 🌐 Opening websites  
- 📥 Downloading files  
- 📋 Copying text to clipboard  
- ⌨️ Starting and stopping a keylogger  

Additionally, it features a user-friendly interface with inline keyboards for quick access to social media links and functionalities.

### Installation

To run this bot, you need to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install telegram
```
```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot
```
```bash
pip install pyautogui
```
```bash
pip install pyperclip
```
This project is a great way to explore the intersection of technology and security! 💡💻
